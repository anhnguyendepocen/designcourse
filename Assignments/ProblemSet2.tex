\maketitle

Due: Tuesday Nov. 10


% use Tennenwald; what is her research question? what is her theory?

% what are alternative theories that might explain the outcome of interest (nuclear non-use)

% develop two alternative theories (aside from the one advanced by Tannenwald) and draw observable implications of those theories.

% are the observable implications of each theory (your two theories, and Tannenwald's) observable equivalent? How would you empirically empirically distinguish your theories from each other and from Tannenwald's?
