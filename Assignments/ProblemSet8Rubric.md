# Problem Set 8 Rubric: Experimentation #

Points possible: 100

 1. Select any article from the reading list for this course. Summarize the paper's research question and theory.

    30: Complete and correct summary of paper's research question and theory is provided.
 
 2. Develop an alternative research design that could be used to answer the paper's research question and test the paper's theory without relying on the methods used in the original paper. Discuss the population from which you would draw cases, how you would select them, what concepts you would operationalize and how, and what type of analysis you would perform. You can use any methods within the following constraints:
 
    a. If the paper uses an experimental or quasi-experimental research design, develop an observational research design.
    b. If the paper uses an observational research design, develop an experimental research design.
    
    40: A reasonable alternative research design is provided, including all necessary elements of data collection and analysis.
    
 3. Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of your design and the original design. Evaluate which would be more useful for drawing inferences.

    20: Strengths and weaknesses of the two research designs are discussed
    10: An evaluation is provided that clearly argues for why one design is superior or in what circumstances each is superior.
