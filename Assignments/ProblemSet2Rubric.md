Points possible: 100

 1. Read the article ``The Nuclear Taboo'' by Nina Tannenwald. What is her research question? What does she want to understand?
 
    10 points: Research question is correctly identified and explained.

 2. What is Tannenwald's theory? Considering the criteria for evaluating a ``good'' theory, how ``good'' is Tannenwald's theory? How could it be improved?
 
    10 points: Tannenwald's theory is correctly and completely described.
    20 points: Evaluation of Tannenwald's theory is clear, well-reasoned, and complete and suggestions for possible improvements are given.

 3. What are one or more alternative explanations for the outcome(s) she is attempting to explain? Why are those alternatives better or worse? How would you empirically distinguish each theory from the other(s), or are they empirically indistinguishable?

    20 points: One or more alternative theories/explanations are provided and explained.
    20 points: Discussion of empirical implications and equivalence is clear, well-reasoned, and complete.
 
 4. Overall, how well does Tannenwald articulate and empirically test her theory? What could be improved?

    10 points: Evaluation of Tannenwald's empirical test is clear, well-reasoned, and complete.
    10 points: Appropriate suggestions for possible improvements to the empirical test are given.
