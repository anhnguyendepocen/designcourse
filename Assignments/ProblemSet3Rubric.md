# Problem Set 2 Rubric: Case Selection #

Points possible: 100

 1. Read the article "China and India" by Jean Dreze and Amartya Sen (available on the course Reading List). In 2-3 sentences, summarize the article. Your summary should include what the article aims to explain, what kinds of comparisons are made, and what conclusion(s) the authors reach. In 1-2 further sentences, argue why you are or are not convinced by their analysis.
  
    10 points: Correctly summarizes the purpose and contents of the article.
    5 points: Provides an evaluation of the article's argument.
 
 2. Thinking of the different kinds of cases and the different uses of cases studies (as discussed in readings and the lecture), what kind of case study (or case studies) are discussed in this article? How do the authors use case studies to achieve their analytic goals?
 
    10 points: Correctly identifies one or more types of case studies used in the article.
    10 points: Correctly identifies one or more methods of comparison (within-case, between-case, etc.) used in the article.
    
 3. The article focuses on India and China. Why? Is this case selection sensible? What are China and India (during this period) *cases of*?

    10 points: Offers an argument for what China and India are cases of.
    10 points: Discusses the selection of cases with reference to sources of variation.
 
 4. Identify what you see as the most important within-case or between-case comparisons made in the article. Why are these important and what do they demonstrate (do they provide description, do they clarify a concept, do they test a theory, etc.)?

    10 points: Identifies two or more comparisons made in the article.
    20 points: Completely describes and justify why these comparisons are important.
 
 5. Rather than comparing two actual cases, the authors could have adopted Fearon's "counterfactual" method of comparison. How would that have been useful here or wouldn't it have been useful? Justify your answer in a few sentences.

    5 points: Demonstrates an understanding of Fearon's "counterfactual" method.
    10 points: Offers a compelling argument for why or why not Fearon's method would have been appropriate and/or useful.
