\section{Purpose}

The purpose of this activity is to provide you with an understanding of regression analysis and to both develop and apply that knowledge to the use of the R statistical programming environment.

\section{Overview}

This lab can be completed during class time and at-home. You should allocate time to complete the relevant portions of the lab in line with the scheduled topics for each week. The two quantitative problem sets in LT relate to, roughly, the first half and second half of the material covered in this lab.

\section{Your Task}

Using R as instructed, complete the following activities.

\subsection{Bivariate Regression}

\begin{enumerate}
\item 

% slope
% correlation
% r-squared

% significance testing of a regression slope

% bootstrapping to show repeated sampling

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Confounding and Matching}

\begin{enumerate}

\item 

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Multivariate Regression}

\begin{enumerate}

\item 

% partial correlations

% intuition underlying multiple regression

% formulas in R

% model fit

% predicted values

% marginal effects

\end{enumerate}
