# Problem Set 5 Rubric: Interviewing #

Points possible: 100

 1. Look at the set of ["Flash" Eurobarometer surveys](http://www.gesis.org/eurobarometer-data-service/survey-series/flash-eb/study-overview/), which are collected as part of a long, ongoing data collection by the European Commission. Select a topic that you would like to study from those available and use the questionnaire provided. In your essay, briefly describe what you see as the research question and/or goals of your selected questionnaire. Also list the "ZA Number" for the study (e.g., ZA6586) and include a link to the questionnaire.
 
    10 points: Research question or purpose is described.
    5 points: Link to study questionnaire is included.
 
 2. Using what you know about interviewing and asking questions, review the questionnaire you have selected and discuss strengths and weaknesses of the questionnaire (such as question wordings, ordering of questions, the "mode" of data collection, etc.). Write up these discussions in up to one page of your essay.

    20 points: Strengths and weaknesses of the questionnaire are discussed.
    
 3. With your questionnaire, collect a pilot data collection in which you interview at least three individuals each (for a total of six individuals). For the purposes of this assignment, it does not matter who you select to interview (friends, family, random individuals). Each interview should comprise two parts: (a) a realistic survey interview in which you ask the questions on the questionnaire and record the answers; and (b) a reflective section where you ask the respondent about what was difficult, confusing, or unclear about the questions being asked. Take notes on the respondents' behaviors, the ease with which they answered the questions, and any comments they made in the reflective portion of the interview. Briefly describe how you selected these individuals and provide some basic characteristics of each (e.g., "a friend, 25 year old female from Liverpool").

    10 points: Respondents are described.
    
 4. With your partner, discuss the experience of interviewing. Then, in about three pages, describe and evaluate the experience of interviewing in this case and what implications that has for interviewing more generally. You might consider the following prompts: What did you learn? How successful was your questionnaire at obtaining appropriate and useful responses? How well did responents understand the questions? How well did they answer the questions? How well do you think this questionnaire and your interviewing would serve the goal of the Eurobarometer study were you to actually conduct the study? What would you change about the questionnaire to improve this data collection? How much should we trust data generated from responses to survey interviews?
 
    10 points: Experiences from interviewing are described.
    20 points: Reflections on the task of interviewing are thorough and well-argued.
    20 points: Analysis and evaluation of this survey questionnaire and survey interviewing more generally are provided and complete.
 
 5. Write up your reflections on the exercise, including identifying the most difficult and most enjoyable aspects.

    5 points: A reflection is provided.
