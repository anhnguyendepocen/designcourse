# Problem Set 7 Rubric: Regression Analysis #

Points possible: 100

 1. Consider an important political science concept that can be measured using either the QoG or ESS datasets. State an interesting research question about the cause(s) and/or effect(s) of that concept. Describe why it is interesting.

    5: Research question is stated that relates concept to other concept(s).
    10: An explanation is offered for why the question is interesting.
 
 2. Develop a theoretical explanation of the causes and/or effects of the concept.
 
    15: A theoretical explanation is offered, in natural language, about the relationship between the core concept and other concepts
 
 3. Draw a directed, acyclic graph (DAG or "causal graph") that describes your theorized relationships between cause, outcome, and one or more confounding factors.
 
    20: A complete DAG is draw that correctly represents the theoretical contribution in (2).
    
 4. Identify variables measured in your chosen dataset that operationalize the concepts in your DAG. Note any measures that must be constructed from multiple measured variables or any concepts that are not operationalized in the available data.
 
    10: A set of appropriate measures of the selected concepts are chosen from the available data
 
 5. Based on your DAG and the variables available to you, perform a regression analysis using R and summarize your results.
 
    20: A complete regression analysis is performed based on the theory, DAG, and selected measures.
 
 6. Discuss implications of your findings and the strengths and weaknesses of this research design for answering your research question.

    10: Implications of findings are discussed
    10: Strengths and weaknesses of research design are discussed.
