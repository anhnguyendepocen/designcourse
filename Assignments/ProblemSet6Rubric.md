# Problem Set 6 Rubric: Basic Statistics #

Points possible: 100

 1. Consider the following research question: ``How healthy are democratic countries compared to less democratic countries?'' Thinking descriptively, develop a hypothesis or expectation about the correlational relationship between democracy and health.
 
    10 points: A reasonable hypothesis is clearly stated.
 
 2. Define the concepts of democracy and health and select one or more appropriate indicators of each concept from the Quality of Government dataset.
 
    5 points: Reasonable conceptual definition of democracy provided.
    5 points: Reasonable conceptual definition of health provided.
    5 points: Reasonable indicator(s) of democracy selected and justified.
    5 points: Reasonable indicator(s) of democracy selected and justified.
 
 3. Create 3 distinct types of visualizations showing different patterns or relationships in your data that are relevant to your hypothesis. For each plot, create a "worse" version and "better" version of the visualization and discuss why the "better" version communicates the pattern or relationship better, either in substantive terms or in purely aesthetic ones.
 
    15 points: 1 reasonable plot created (5), 2 reasonable plots created (10), 3 reasonable plots created (15)
    10 points: A complete and coherent discussion of the trade-offs between visualizations is provided.
 
 4. Provide one or more quantitative summaries of your data using tables, cross-tabulations, and/or other statistics. Interpret these summaries and your visualizations in terms of your research question and hypothesis. Are the data consistent with your expectations?
 
    5 points: One or more quantitative summaries are provided (e.g., table, cross-table, means, proportions, correlations, etc.)
    10 points: A coherent and correct interpretation of the summaries is given, is consistent with the data, and is interpreted correctly with respect to the hypothesis.
 
 5. Using an appropriate statistical test, evaluate the size of the relationship between democracy and health, assess whether that relationship appears to statistically differ from no relationship, and interpret the resulting measures of uncertainty for the test.
 
    10 points: One or more appropriate statistical tests are implemented, are interpreted correctly, and relevant measures of uncertainty (standard errors, test-statistics, confidence intervals, p-values, etc.) are interpreted correctly.
 
 6. Consider the issue of causality. Are the relationships observed in these data reflective of a causal relationship? What criteria would have to be satisfied for any relationship between democracy and health to be causal?
 
    10 points: A complete discussion of causal inference is given that connects the available evidence to the criteria for asserting a causal claim.
 
 7. In a few sentences, reflect on the most challenging and most rewarding aspects of this assignment. State any uncertainties you currently have about the material covered by this assignment and reflect on what you will do to address those uncertainties.

    5 points: Completed reflection.
    
    5 points: A complete, reproducible R syntax file is included with the assignment.
