# Problem Set 7: Regression Analysis #

## Purpose ##

The purpose of this problem set is to assess your understanding of regression analysis and its use in drawing descriptive and causal inferences from quantitative data.

## Overview ##

You will develop a research question about the cause of a factor or the effect of a factor, draw and describe a causal graph of the relationships between cause, effect, and any other confounding variables, and perform a regression analysis using data from either the Quality of Government dataset or European Social Survey dataset.

You will organize and present your results in the form of a short, 7-page slidedeck that reports your research question, theoretical graph, described analysis, and results. You may be asked to present your slide deck in class.

## Your Task ##

 1. Consider an important political science concept that can be measured using either the QoG or ESS datasets. State an interesting research question about the cause(s) and/or effect(s) of that concept. Describe why it is interesting.
 
 2. Develop a theoretical explanation of the causes and/or effects of the concept.
 
 3. Draw a directed, acyclic graph (DAG or "causal graph") that describes your theorized relationships between cause, outcome, and one or more confounding factors.
 
 4. Identify variables measured in your chosen dataset that operationalize the concepts in your DAG. Note any measures that must be constructed from multiple measured variables or any concepts that are not operationalized in the available data.
 
 5. Based on your DAG and the variables available to you, perform a regression analysis using R and summarize your results.
 
 6. Discuss implications of your findings and the strengths and weaknesses of this research design for answering your research question.

## Submission Instructions ##

Your assignment should consist of exactly 7 slides (the first slide should be a title slide), saved in PDF format. Submit the assignment via Moodle by Tuesday, March 8. You may work with others in developing your project and analyzing the results, but you should each have an individual and distinct research question, analysis, and slidedeck.

## Feedback ##

You will receive feedback within two weeks and may be asked to present and obtain feedback during lecture or class.
