# Problem Set 6: Basic Statistics #

## Purpose ##

The purpose of this problem set is to assess your understanding of basic methods of quantitative data description and summarization, and the statistical assumptions underlying those methods.

## Overview ##

You will use the [Quality of Government](http://www.qogdata.pol.gu.se/) dataset to provide a quantitative description of the quality of democratic institutions across the world. Note: You may use the "Standard" dataset (which is based on a single cross-section of data) or the "Time Series" dataset (which has country-year observations).

## Your Task ##

 1. Consider the following research question: ``How healthy are democratic countries compared to less democratic countries?'' Thinking descriptively, develop a hypothesis or expectation about the correlational relationship between democracy and health.
 
 2. Define the concepts of democracy and health and select one or more appropriate indicators of each concept from the Quality of Government dataset.
 
 3. Create 3 distinct types of visualizations showing different patterns or relationships in your data that are relevant to your hypothesis. For each plot, create a "worse" version and "better" version of the visualization and discuss why the "better" version communicates the pattern or relationship better, either in substantive terms or in purely aesthetic ones.
 
 4. Provide one or more quantitative summaries of your data using tables, cross-tabulations, and/or other statistics. Interpret these summaries and your visualizations in terms of your research question and hypothesis. Are the data consistent with your expectations?
 
 5. Using an appropriate statistical test, evaluate the size of the relationship between democracy and health, assess whether that relationship appears to statistically differ from no relationship, and interpret the resulting measures of uncertainty for the test.
 
 6. Consider the issue of causality. Are the relationships observed in these data reflective of a causal relationship? What criteria would have to be satisfied for any relationship between democracy and health to be causal?
 
 7. In a few sentences, reflect on the most challenging and most rewarding aspects of this assignment. State any uncertainties you currently have about the material covered by this assignment and reflect on what you will do to address those uncertainties.

## Submission Instructions ##

Your assignment should be no more than 3 pages of double-spaced A4, Times New Roman font size 12.

Your visualizations **do not** count against the page total.

As an appendix to your submission, include all relevant R code used to generate your results and figures. This should be typed in Courier New font size 10.

You should submit individual assignments on this task.

Submit the assignment via Moodle by Tuesday, February 23.

## Feedback ##

You will receive feedback within two weeks.
