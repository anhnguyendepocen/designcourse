# Problem Set 4: Text Analysis #

## Purpose ##

The purpose of this assignment is to assess your ability to evaluate the utility of text analysis, apply different techniques, and to gain experience with the interpretation of real political texts.

## Overview ##

You are being given some example texts to consider. Working in teams, you will ask a research question that can be answered using texts. This should be descriptive in nature. Considering several possible techniques of text analysis, apply one or more techniques to the example text, describe your interpretations, and evaluate the extent to which meaningful insights can be gained from the approach you chose compared to other approaches. In the end, you will also write a short (one-paragraph) reflection on the activity.

## Your Task ##

 1. You are being given copies of the 2015 election manifestos for several of the largest political parties in the UK. These manifestos represent a significant body of text that communicates each party's issue priorities, positions, values, and so forth. Your goal is to draw meaningful interpretations from these texts using any method of text analysis.
 
 2. You have been randomly assigned to teams. You must complete the entirety of the assignment working in these teams and submit a group assignment in written form that summarizes the following:
 
   - What is your (descriptive) research question that you hope to answer by examining these texts? You migth consider looking at discourses, frames, or arguments used in one or more texts, measuring the ideology or sentiment of the texts, identifying issue priorities, measuring text complexity, etc.
   - Which manifesto or manifestos have you chosen to analyze? What is your unit of analysis (manifesto, issue, sentence, etc.)?
   - What methods of text analysis might be appropriate to answering your research question? Why have you chosen the method or methods you have selected?
   - How did you analyze the texts? (Be specific. Provide enough information that someone else could read your instructions and reproduce the results you obtained.)
   - What did you find? Do the interpretations you reached using text analysis have face validity?
   
 3. Use Moodle, email, or in-person meetings to coordinate the completion of this problem set. 
 
 4. Submit a written document summarizing your research question, empirical approach, and findings.
 
 5. Individually, write up your reflections on the exercise (write no more than one paragraph in length). You should reflect on the assignment, your own learning, and how well your group worked to complete the assignment.


## Submission Instructions ##

Your assignment should be no more than 8 pages of double-spaced A4, Times New Roman font size 12. Submit the assignment via Moodle by Tuesday, December 15. Each team member should submit a copy of the assignment. All copies should be identical except for the inclusion of your individual reflection statement.

## Feedback ##

You will receive feedback within two weeks.
