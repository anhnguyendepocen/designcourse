# Problem Set 3: Case Selection #

## Purpose ##

The purpose of this assignment is to assess your ability to identify and select cases for study, make comparisons between cases, analyze case study data, and evaluate the utility of case study methods?

## Overview ##

You are being given a published article to read and evaluate. You need to identify features of the article's analysis and evaluate the quality of that analysis based on what you know about case studies.

## Your Task ##

 1. Read the article "China and India" by Jean Dreze and Amartya Sen (available on the course Reading List). In 2-3 sentences, summarize the article. Your summary should include what the article aims to explain, what kinds of comparisons are made, and what conclusion(s) the authors reach. In 1-2 further sentences, argue why you are or are not convinced by their analysis.
 
 2. Thinking of the different kinds of cases and the different uses of cases studies (as discussed in readings and the lecture), what kind of case study (or case studies) are discussed in this article? How do the authors use case studies to achieve their analytic goals?
 
 3. The article focuses on India and China. Why? Is this case selection sensible? What are China and India (during this period) *cases of*?
 
 4. Identify what you see as the most important within-case or between-case comparisons made in the article. Why are these important and what do they demonstrate (do they provide description, do they clarify a concept, do they test a theory, etc.)?
 
 5. Rather than comparing two actual cases, the authors could have adopted Fearon's "counterfactual" method of comparison. How would that have been useful here or wouldn't it have been useful? Justify your answer in a few sentences.
 
 6. In a few sentences, briefly reflect on what was easy or difficult about this assignment and provide any feedback on the assignment for the instructor.

## Submission Instructions ##

Your assignment should be no more than 3 pages of double-spaced A4, Times New Roman font size 12. Submit the assignment via Moodle by Tuesday, November 24.

## Feedback ##

You will receive feedback within two weeks.
