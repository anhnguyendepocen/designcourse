	What Is a Case Study and What Is It Good for?
	
	JOHN GERRING Boston University
	
	
	This paper aims to clarify the meaning, and explain the utility, of
	the case study method, a methodoften practiced but little understood.
	A “case study,” I argue, is best de?ned as an intensive studyof a
	single unit with an aim to generalize across a larger set of units.
	Case studies rely on the
	
	same sort of covariational evidence utilized in non-case study research.
	Thus, the case study method is
	
	correctly understood as a particular way of de?ning cases, not a way
	of analyzing cases or a way of
	
	modeling causal relations. I show that this understanding of the subject
	illuminates some of the persistent
	
	ambiguities of case studywork, ambiguities that are, to some extent,
	intrinsic to the enterprise. The travails
	
	of the case study within the discipline of political science are also
	rooted in an insuf?cient appreciation of
	
	themethodological tradeoffs that thismethod calls forth. This paper
	presents the familiar contrast between
	
	case study and non-case study work as a series of characteristic strengths
	and weaknesses—af?nities—
	
	rather than as antagonistic approaches to the empirical world. In
	the end, the perceived hostility between
	
	case study and non-case study research is largely unjusti?ed and,
	perhaps, deserves to be regarded as a
	
	misconception. Indeed, the strongest conclusion to arise from this
	methodological examination concerns
	
	the complementarity of single-unit and cross-unit research designs.
	
	
	The case study occupies a vexed position in the tion of work generated
	by the discipline, the case studydiscipline of political science.
	On the one hand, method is held in low regard or is simply ignored.

  volume = {5},

  abstract = {When political scientists present empirical results, they are much
	more likely to use tables than graphs, despite the fact that graphs
	greatly increases the clarity of presentation and makes it easier
	for a reader to understand the data being used and to draw clear
	and correct inferences.Using a sample of leading journals, we document
	this tendency and suggest reasons why researchers prefer tables.
	We argue that the extra work required in producing graphs is rewarded
	by greatly enhanced presentation and communication of empirical results.We
	illustrate their benefits by turning several published tables into
	graphs, including tables that present descriptive data and regression
	results.We show that regression graphs emphasize point estimates
	and confidence intervals and that they can successfully present the
	results of regression models. A move away from tables towards graphs
	would improve the discipline’s communicative output and make empirical
	findings more accessible to every type of audience.},
