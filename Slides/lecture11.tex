\title{Causality: Explanation versus Prediction}

% Political science is generally concerned with questions of causality. To do that we need to learn to think counterfactually. How do we know that something causes something else? How do we separate ``correlation'' from ``causation''?

% Goal is to develop ways of thinking about how to distinguish causation from association/correlation

% examples of associations (tempurature/pirates; crime/ice cream; )
