\title{Translating Texts into Interpretations and Numbers}

% Primary and secondary source documents provide a written record of politically relevant events and processes. Texts can be used in a number of ways in political science research. How do we draw meaning from texts in qualitative and quantitative ways? How does textual information become useful data for making political inferences?

\begin{itemize}\itmesep1em
\item Think about your own experience reading, interpreting, and interacting with textual sources for academic purposes (e.g, for writing a term paper).
\item With the person sitting next to you, discuss:
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item The process by which you try to understand the meaning and content of texts
	\item How you choose texts to read
	\end{enumerate}

% texts in lieu of observation
% we cannot see everything ourselves, so we rely on evidence

% texts as CPOs vs. DSOs


% selection bias -> when do we stop looking for evidence?
% -> how do we know that we have all of the evidence?
% -> If we go looking for information about a case as something, do we miss evidence that sees that case as a case of something else?

% define historiography

% texts are subjective


% research questions and text: 
%% at one level, texts can be used to answer any research question
%% there are, however, a lot of interesting research questions that are about text per se

% what is the sentiment of this text?
% what is the ideology of this text?
% what discourses or frames does this text communicate?
% what issues does this text mention?
% how does this text differ from other texts (by other actors, from other time periods)?
% what do these several texts have in common?
% can we categorize texts to reveal something about their authors (e.g., their ideology, their emotional state, their intelligence)?


% unit of analysis???
% text, paragraph, sentence
% multiple texts that represent some larger unit (speaker/source, country, party)


\section{Content Analysis}
\frame{\tableofcontents[currentsection]}

% definition: systematic description of the content of a communication

% can be applied to any kind of document (primary, secondary, tertiary)
% need not be textual (we can content analyze images, videos, audio, actions/behaviors/expressions)
% graph showing textual input of one or more strings of text into an output of numbers/scores


% what are the variables? what do we want to know about this text?


% scoring: ideology, positivity/negativity (both rely on word associations)
% dictionary methods (sentiment: lexicoder, ideology: wordfish)

% sentiment
If only all politicians could \textit<3->{believe} in Britain as UKIP does.
