% what is political science?

% what makes for interesting questions?

% how do we describe the world? and evaluate alternative ways of describing the world?

% how do we generate theories and accumulate knowledge?

% how do we draw causal inferences? what kinds of comparisons should we make?

% what are methods that can be used to generate causal inferences?

% how do we choose methods? how do we balance trade-offs between methods?
