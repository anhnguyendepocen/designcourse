\title{Translating Texts into Interpretations and Numbers}

% Primary and secondary source documents provide a written record of politically relevant events and processes. Texts can be used in a number of ways in political science research. How do we draw meaning from texts in qualitative and quantitative ways? How does textual information become useful data for making political inferences?

\frametitle{Content Analysis}

\begin{itemize}\itemsep0.5em
\item Definition: ``systematic description of the contents of a communication''
\item Treat texts as DSOs or a source of multiple DSOs
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Data set observation: score for a case on a variable
	\end{itemize}
\item Technique can be applied to any kind of document
\end{itemize}

}

% can be applied to any kind of document (primary, secondary, tertiary)
% need not be textual (we can content analyze images, videos, audio, actions/behaviors/expressions)
% graph showing textual input of one or more strings of text into an output of numbers/scores


\frame{

\frametitle{Content Analysis Process}

\begin{enumerate}
\item<1-> Define a research question
\item<2-> Define concepts
\item<3-> Select texts
\item<4-> Create a \textit{codebook} that describes how to operationalize concepts using text
\item<5-> Assign scores to texts based on codebook
\item<6-> Summarize results
\end{enumerate}

}

% RQs and concepts are linked:
% what is the sentiment of this text?
% what is the ideology of this text?
% what ideas/arguments/frames/discourses are presented in this text?
% Tend to be descriptive RQs; causal inferences will come later once we've described the text fully
% content analysis is almost always comparative (comparing sources, authors, time period, contexts, etc.)

% what are the variables? what do we want to know about this text?

% scoring: ideology, positivity/negativity (both rely on word associations)
% dictionary methods (sentiment: lexicoder, ideology: wordfish)



\frame{

\frametitle{Example 1: Categorization}

\begin{itemize}\itemsep0.5em
\item Common RQ relates to categorization:\\ What is this text saying?
\item Example RQs:

	\begin{itemize}
	\item What arguments are raised in this text?
	\item Are certain ideas more prevalent in some texts than others?
	\item How is an issue discussed in politics?
	\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

If only they could share our \textbf<2>{positive vision of Britain} as a \textbf<2>{proud}, \textbf<3-4>{independent sovereign nation}, a \textbf<4>{country respected on the world stage}, a \textbf<4>{major player in global trade}, with \textbf<4>{influence and authority} when it comes to tackling the pressing international issues of the day.

% categorization: 
% identification of frames, arguments, discourse

% discourses/frames
% 1: national pride/patriotism
% 2: independence

\begin{itemize}
\item Developed deductively
	\begin{enumerate}\itemsep0.5em
	\item Start with set of concepts

\frametitle{Developing Codebooks II}

\begin{itemize}
\item Developed inductively
	\begin{enumerate}\itemsep0.5em
	\item Examine texts for key ideas and expressions
	\item Create a set of categories that summarize those expressions
	\item Examine new texts for expressions of those categories
	\item Expand and clarify the codebook as new concepts or expressions emerge
	\end{enumerate}

\frametitle{Codebook Examples}

\begin{enumerate}
\item<1-> Assign 1 if the text mentions ``Europe''
\item<2-> Count times ``Europe'' is mentioned
\item<3-> More complex example:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Assign +1 if mentions ``Europe'' positively
	\item Assign -1 if mentions ``Europe'' negatively
	\item Assign 0 if text does not mention ``Europe''
	\end{itemize}
\item<4-> List all frames used in the text
\item<5-> Count number of words (or characters) in sentence
