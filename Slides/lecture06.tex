\title{Deriving Hypotheses from Theory}

% Hypotheses are the observable implications of theories. How do we derive hypotheses from theories? How do we overcome ``observational equivalence'' wherein multiple theories yield similar expectations about the world? What does it mean to test a hypothesis?

	\begin{itemize}
	\item A tentative conjecture about the causes of some phenomenon of interest
	\item An argument that attempts to explain how concepts are causally related

\frametitle{Generality \& Parsimony}

Think for 90 seconds about each of these principles:

\small 

\begin{itemize}\itemsep1em
\item Generality: Theories that can explain more are preferred over theories that can explain less
\item Parsimony: Simple theories are preferred over complex theories
\end{itemize}

\normalsize

Are these principles defensible?\\ Are they any good?

\section{Generating Hypotheses}
\frame{\tableofcontents[currentsection]}


\frame{

\frametitle{Hypotheses}

\begin{itemize}\itemsep0.5em
\item<2-> Definition: a theory-based statement about a relationship that we expect to observe.\footnote{Kellstedt and Whitten (p.4)}

\item<3-> Features
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Derived from theory
	\item Specific
	\item Empirical/observable
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

}

% we cannot test theory; we can only test observable implications of theory
% hypotheses are statements about observable implications
% finding support for a hypothesis is evidence in support of a theory
% finding lack of support for a hypothesis is evidence against a theory



\frame{

\frametitle{How do we generate hypotheses?}

\begin{itemize}\itemsep0.5em
\item Think about \textit{observable implications}
\item What would evidence consistent with this theory be?
\item What would evidence inconsistent with this theory be?
	\begin{itemize}
	\item<2-> This is \textit{falsifiability}
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

}

% falsifiability
	% typically talked about in descriptive terms (all swans are white)
	% can be harder to think of non-falsifiable causal arguments
		% theories without observable implications (homeopathy; remote viewing)
		% ethics are non-falsifiable without a predetermined set of rules governing what is and is not ethical

% Examples from Rosenbaum

\frametitle{Example: Broad Street Cholera}

\begin{itemize}\itemsep0.5em
\item 1854 outbreak of cholera in London
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Around Broad Street (Soho)
	\item 616 eventual deaths
	\end{itemize}
\item<2-> What causes transmission of cholera?
\item<3-> Dominant theory at time: ``miasma''
\item<4-> Hypotheses:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Clean up garbage $\rightarrow\hspace{1em} \downarrow$ cholera
	\item Open windows $\rightarrow \hspace{1em} \downarrow$ cholera
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Observational Equivalence}

\begin{itemize}\itemsep1em
\item Definition: All hypotheses for two (or more) theories are identical
\item What to do?
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Generate more specific expectations % maybe alternative DVs; more fine grained hypothesis; moderators; etc.
	\item Move outside scope conditions
	\item Settle for lack of explanation
	\end{itemize}
