\title{Deriving Hypotheses from Theory}

% Hypotheses are the observable implications of theories. How do we derive hypotheses from theories? How do we overcome ``observational equivalence'' wherein multiple theories yield similar expectations about the world? What does it mean to test a hypothesis?

\begin{itemize}
\item What are theories?
	\begin{itemize}
	\item A tentative conjecture about the causes of some phenomenon of interest
	\item An argument that attempts to explain how concepts are causally related
	\end{itemize}
\item Deduction and Induction
\item Evaluating theories

\frametitle{Generality \& Parsimony}

Think for 90 seconds about each of these principles:

\small 

\begin{itemize}\itemsep1em
\item Generality: Theories that can explain more are preferred over theories that can explain less
\item Parsimony: Simple theories are preferred over complex theories
\end{itemize}

\normalsize

Are these principles defensible?\\ Are they any good?

\section{Generating Hypotheses}
\frame{\tableofcontents[currentsection]}


% define hypothesis



% what does it mean to "test" a theory?

% generating observable implications

% observational equivalence
% distinguishing between rival theories


\section{Hypothesis Testing}
\frame{\tableofcontents[currentsection]}


% principles of testing
% thinking counterfactually
	% question of deterministic and probabilistic causality
	% multiple causation
	% equifinality of multiple causes
% multiple specific forms of testing, which we'll be exposed to over the coming weeks


% realizing that we will always be inductive and we may go into the field to test a theory and end up instead generating a new theory







% arbitrating between good and bad tests of a theory

% distinguish between training set and test set
