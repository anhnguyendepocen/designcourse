\title{Measurement: Concepts in Practice}

% To study something, we need to be able to observe and measure it. How do we \textit{operationalize} concepts so that we can study political phenomena? What are challenges of measuring concepts? How do we assign quantitative values to observations?

Concept definition

Classical approach (minimal, maximal, ordinal)

Family resemblance approach





\section{Measurement}

Recall definition of variable:

\item \textit{Observation}: A case or unit (e.g., person, country)
\item \textit{Variable}: A dimension that describes an observation (e.g., income)



Operationalization = Creating measures for concepts






Measures follow from concept definitions

Definitions of democracy from Gerring: How do we operationalize these things?



Activity around this



Construct Validity



Threats to Construct Validity (Shadish, Cook, and Campbell Table 3.1 (p.73))

- Bad concept definition

- Mono-operation and mono-method bias: when the operationalization mismeasures the concept or when the operationalization itself becomes part of the concept (e.g., self-reported income versus actual income)

- Experimenter expectancies: does the implmeentation of the experiment actually expose units to things other than the concept of interest (e.g., by encouraging particular types of behavior aside from the behavior of interest)

- Compensatory equalization and rivalry: Knowledge of treatment status actually changes behavior

- Treatment diffusion: Stable unit treatment value assumption from Holland



Quantitative measures versus Qualitative measures

Example: democracy




Reliability

Accuracy





An example

Definition: *Opinion* is a summary evaluation of a particular object

Operationalization?


Agree/disagree

Oppose/support

Degree of favorability

Warm/cool

Positive/negative

Implicit/explicit

How many scale points?
