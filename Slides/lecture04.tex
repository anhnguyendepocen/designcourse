\title{Measurement: Concepts in Practice}

% To study something, we need to be able to observe and measure it. How do we \textit{operationalize} concepts so that we can study political phenomena? What are challenges of measuring concepts? How do we assign quantitative values to observations?

Operationalization = Measurement

% stuff from Kellstedt and Whitten



Threats to Construct Validity (Shadish, Cook, and Campbell Table 3.1 (p.73))

  - Bad concept definition
  
  - Mono-operation and mono-method bias: when the operationalization mismeasures the concept or when the operationalization itself becomes part of the concept (e.g., self-reported income versus actual income)
  
  - Experimenter expectancies: does the implmeentation of the experiment actually expose units to things other than the concept of interest (e.g., by encouraging particular types of behavior aside from the behavior of interest)
  
  - Compensatory equalization and rivalry: Knowledge of treatment status actually changes behavior
  
  - Treatment diffusion: Stable unit treatment value assumption from Holland


An example

Definition: *Opinion* is a summary evaluation of a particular object

Operationalization?


Agree/disagree

Oppose/support

Degree of favorability

Warm/cool

Positive/negative

Implicit/explicit

How many scale points?
