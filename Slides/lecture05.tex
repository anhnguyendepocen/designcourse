\frametitle{Assessing Measures II}

\begin{itemize}\itemsep0.5em
\item Construct validity is the degree to which a variable measures a concept\footnote{Note: Kellstedt and Whitten call this ``content validity''. They use ``construct validity'' to mean whether a measure has predictive validity (i.e., that the measure is related to measures of other concepts that are theorized to be related).}
\item<2-> Construct validity is \textbf{high} if a variable is a measure of the concept we care about
\item<3-> Construct validity is \textbf{low} if a variable is actually a measure of something else
\end{itemize}
}

% sources: bad concept definition; totally inappropriate measures (using income to measure weight); measure becomes the concept (actual income is replaced by self-reported income)

\begin{itemize}\itemsep1em
\item Multiple measures!
\item Convergence (Convergent validity)
\item Discrimination (Discriminant validity)
\end{itemize}
}

% two (or more) measures of the same concept are highly correlated; scaling
% two (or more) measures of distinct concepts are not correlated
% Measures of distinct concepts may be correlated if they are causally related to one another, so simple correlations do not mean two measures are necessarily of the same concept

% mention predictive validity (what Kellstedt and Whitten call construct validity)

% theories are arguments and they are (potential) explanations

\frametitle{Induction vs. Deduction?}

\begin{itemize}\itemsep0.5em
\item Induction and deduction are both integral to science

% example: the calculus of voting; modified theory based on new evidence

\item Theory testing and theory building both require observation
\end{itemize}

}

% the second calculus of voting (Riker and Ordeshook) was partly inductive

% theory development is separate from theory testing
% but the two are interrelated



% induction (bottom up) vs. deduction (top down; from theory to observation)
% generally, in political science, we are interested in building theories from earlier more acceptable theoretical premises
% if we believe the world operates in some way, we can draw more specific conjectures about features of the world
% and then test those conjectures using evidence

% yet, the result is that when we collect evidence, sometimes we falsify (or fail to find evidence in support of) our theories
% the results is that we must either amend our premises, amend our argument, or set scope conditions on theory

% these theories then become useful because by drawing generalities about the world, we are able to understand particular events
% when those particular events then deviate from expectations, it invites renewed theorizing, amendment of argument, or the implication of scope conditions

% so science is both deductive and inductive, though the way we talk about science is typically deductive


% in the end, however, our goal is to "explain" the world...that has to start from a mix of assumption-based theory, theory development expanding on previously validated theory, and novel data collection

\frametitle{Theory Generation in Practice}

As you theorize an explanation for some phenomenon, you will draw on:

\begin{itemize}\itemsep1em
\item General principles
\item Extant theory
% application; generalization; moderation; scope conditions; proposing mechanisms for extant relationships
\item Specific evidence
% don't use the evidence we will eventually test our theory on
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{{\large What makes for a good theory?}}

\item Falsifiability

\item Coherence

\item Parsimony

\frame{

\frametitle{Generality \& Parsimony}

Think for 90 seconds about each of these principles:

\small 

\begin{itemize}\itemsep1em
\item Generality: Theories that can explain more are preferred over theories that can explain less
\item Parsimony: Simple theories are preferred over complex theories
\end{itemize}

\normalsize

Are these principles defensible?\\ Are they any good?

\frame{
\frametitle{Preview}

\begin{itemize}\itemsep0.5em
\item Drawing inferences requires tests
\item Testing theories requires observation of reality
\item Focus on two tasks:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Generating specific ``observable implications'' of theories
	\item Discuss how to distinguish between rival theories
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
}

% evidence + rules for evaluating evidence
%% what counts as evidence and rules for evaluating evidence vary quite a bit

% broadly, we "test" theories by drawing observable implications of those theories, such that the theories are "observationally inequivalent" (each theory would produce different expectations about how the world would look), and then updating our beliefs about the alternative theories (such that the one more consistent with evidence is more likely to be "true")

% there is no truth, there are only beliefs about the true nature of the world
