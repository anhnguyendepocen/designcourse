\begin{itemize}\itemsep1em
\item Tertiary sources
\item Secondary sources
\item Primary sources
\end{itemize}

% tertiary: compendia or indices of two other types of sources
% secondary: interpretations of raw evidence
% primary: raw evidence

\frametitle{How do you use texts?}

\small

\begin{itemize}\itemsep0.75em
\item Think about your own experience reading, interpreting, and interacting with textual sources for academic purposes (e.g, for writing a term paper).
\item With the person sitting next to you, discuss:
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item The process by which you try to understand the meaning and content of texts
	\item How you choose texts to read
	\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Use of Texts}

\begin{itemize}\itemsep1em
\item<1-> Text as desription
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Rely on text in lieu of direct observation
	\item Possibly serve as basis of CPO
	\end{itemize}
\item<2-> Text as DSOs
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Treat texts as units
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


}

% texts in lieu of observation
% we cannot see everything ourselves, so we rely on evidence

% texts as CPOs vs. DSOs

\frametitle{Challenges of Text}

\begin{enumerate}\itemsep1em
\item Subjectivity
\item Historiography
\item Selection bias
\end{enumerate}

}


% selection bias -> when do we stop looking for evidence?
% -> how do we know that we have all of the evidence?
% -> If we go looking for information about a case as something, do we miss evidence that sees that case as a case of something else?

% define historiography

% texts are subjective

% what is this a case of 

% research questions and text: 
%% at one level, texts can be used to answer any research question
%% there are, however, a lot of interesting research questions that are about text per se

% unit of analysis???
% text, paragraph, sentence
% multiple texts that represent some larger unit (speaker/source, country, party)
