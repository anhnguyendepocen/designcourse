\title{Case Studies}

% Case studies are in-depth examinations of a single manifestation of a political phenomenon and are one of the most common methods of inquiry in political science. What can we do with case studies? How do they help us to understand politics?

	% can we observe the counterfactual (in another case, in the same case at another time, in a collection of other cases)?
	% if not, can we think about what that counterfactual might look like?

% what is a case study?

% what is it for? description, inductive theory development, testing causal hypotheses (esp. case comparisons, process-tracing, Fearon's ``counterfactual method'')

% most likely (hypothesis confirming)
% least likely (hypothesis weakening)
% deviant cases (hypothesis generating)
% new case, what is something, what explains it?

% make a distinction about a specific instance of a causal relationship and a general pattern of a causal relationship
% tests might only be about a single case but actually apply more generally
