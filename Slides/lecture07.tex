\title{Case Studies}

% Case studies are in-depth examinations of a single manifestation of a political phenomenon and are one of the most common methods of inquiry in political science. What can we do with case studies? How do they help us to understand politics?

	% can we observe the counterfactual (in another case, in the same case at another time, in a collection of other cases)?
	% if not, can we think about what that counterfactual might look like?

``the illegal use of violence or threat by an individual or a group in service of a political agenda with the intention of creating a climate of fear or insecurity''
\item Essential features:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Illegal use of violence or threat
	\item Carried out by individual or group
	\item Service to a political agenda
	\item Intention to create climate of fear or insecurity

	\item Carried out by (individual or group)
	\item Service to a political agenda
	\item Intention to create (climate of fear or insecurity)
	\end{itemize}
\item Examples of sufficiency:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item 1,3,4 (allows state actions to be terrorism)
	\item 2,3,4 (allows non-violence to be to be terrorism)
	\item 1,2,4 (allows criminal activity to be terrorism)

\frametitle{Operationalization}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Measure features
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Level of measurement
	\item How to score each case on each feature
	\item Be concrete (e.g., carbombing versus railway bombing)
	\end{itemize}
\item Aggregate feature measurements
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Sum? Average? AND logical?
	\item Level of measurement of final scale
	\item Range of possible values
	\item Justify against criticisms/alternatives
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

}

% measuring violence might require an OR logical operationalization (listing of possible forms of violence)
% might be measures of victims (number hurt or killed); this could then be interval, or reduced categorical, or binary
% might be property damage and/or victims
% attributes might need to be weighted

% an instance or observation can be a case of many different things
% September 11th might be a case of terrorism, of structural deficiencies in buildings, of airplane hijacking, of airport security, of intelligence failure, of presidential leadership, of the onset of war, of "rallying around the flag", etc.
