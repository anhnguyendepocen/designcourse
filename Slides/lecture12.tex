	\item Is the question easy for respondents to understand?
	\item Are the number and types of response options appropriate?
	\item Are the categories sufficiently distinct from one another?
	\item Is a ``no opinion,'' ``don't know,'' or ``neither support nor oppose'' response option available?
	\item Is one survey item (i.e., one question) sufficient to measure this construct?
	\item How long does it take to read and answer this question?

\item Retrospective think-alouds (in which respondents describe how they arrive at their answers either just after they provide them or at the end of the interview)
\item Paraphrasing (in which respondents restate the question in their own words)
\item Definitions (in which respondents provide definitions for the key terms in the question)
\item Probes (in which respondents answer follow-up questions designed to reveal their response strategies)

\begin{itemize}\itemsep1em
\item A common approach in case study research
\item Definition: ``Participant observation is a research strategy whereby the researcher becomes involved in a social situation for the purpose of understanding the behaviour of those engaged in the setting\dots The outcome of the research is a detailed account of the activities and behaviour of those involved.''\footnote{p.265 from Burnham et al. 2008. \textit{Research Methods in Politics}. 2nd Edition. Palgrave.}
\item<2-> Does this generate DSO or CPOs?

\item Choose one of the following contexts:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Observe Corbyn's shadow cabinet meetings
	\item Observe the core leadership of Britain First
	\end{itemize}
\item Consider:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item What is your research question?
	\item What kinds of observations do you make?
	\item What constraints are placed on what you can do, say, observe, and record?
	\item What perspectives/biases do you bring to the situation?
