\title{Causal Mechanisms and Process-Tracing}

% Aside from knowing that one thing (X) caused another thing (Y), we often want to know how that causal process worked. This is the study of ``causal mechanisms''. How do we study causal mechanisms to gain a deeper understanding of causal relationships in politics? How do we study the process by which a causal effect plays out?

\section{Review}
\frame{\tableofcontents[currentsection]}

% case comparisons

% what kinds of evidence do we collect for case studies?
% we collect observations to score cases on variables
% we also collect ``causal process observations''


\section{Mechanisms}
\frame{\tableofcontents[currentsection]}

% causal graphs

% causality is complicated
% do we care about mechanisms? how deep do we want to go into a mechanism?


% mechanisms allow us to talk about direct and ``mediated'' effects

\section{Process Tracing}
\frame{\tableofcontents[currentsection]}

% application of logic and ``counterfactual'' method
% update beliefs about counterfactuals in sequence


\section{Preview}

% individual research project
% next three weeks are on data collection techniques (text, interviews, and observation)
% PS4 on text analysis (post next week; due in December)
% remainder of course from February onward is about quantitative analysis
