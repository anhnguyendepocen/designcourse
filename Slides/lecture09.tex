\title{Causal Mechanisms and Process-Tracing}

% Aside from knowing that one thing (X) caused another thing (Y), we often want to know how that causal process worked. This is the study of ``causal mechanisms''. How do we study causal mechanisms to gain a deeper understanding of causal relationships in politics? How do we study the process by which a causal effect plays out?

	\begin{itemize}
	\item Many uses of case studies
	\item In case comparisons (last week), we focused on scoring cases on variables to test theories \textit{between cases}
	\item Now we focus on \textit{within-case} comparisons

\item Definition: ``An insight or piece of data that provides information about the context, process, or mechanism, and that contributes distinctive leverage in causal inference''\footnote{Brady and Collier 2004, p.277}
\item Might be used to:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Inductively generate hypotheses about potential causal relationships
	\item Deductively test a chain of causal relationships
	\end{itemize}

% that is to say: how are cause and outcome linked causally?




% causal graphs

% causality is complicated
% do we care about mechanisms? how deep do we want to go into a mechanism?


% mechanisms allow us to talk about direct and ``mediated'' effects

\section{Process Tracing}
\frame{\tableofcontents[currentsection]}

% at its most basic level, it answers ``what happened?'' (i.e., it is descriptive history)
% the difference, however, is that it is about causal inference, which is implicitly about within-case counterfactuals
% generally, these are treated with a deterministic perspective on causality (if this hadn't happened, what would have happened instead?)
% class examples: Sherlock Holmes stories are process-tracing tests of how murders (or other crimes) that link a potential cause (a murderer) to an outcome (a death) via a series of causal steps that leave behind pieces of evidence

% application of logic and ``counterfactual'' method
% update beliefs about counterfactuals in sequence

% inductive versus deductive approach
% process tracing as a standalone method versus as a supplement to other methods
	% for exmaple, often use very aggregated data to establish a relationship and process tracing to document how it comes about


% high amounts of uncertainty
