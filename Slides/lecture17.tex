\frametitle{Process Tracing}

\begin{itemize}\itemsep0.5em
\item Definition: ``analysis of processes of change that seeks to uncover causal mechanisms and causal sequences''\footnote{p.300 from Brady, H.E., and Collier, D. 2004. \textit{Rethinking Social Inquiry}. Rowman \& Littlefield.}
\item Single-case method
\item Focused on gathering CPOs
\item Sequence of counterfactuals
\end{itemize}

}


% at its most basic level, it answers ``what happened?'' (i.e., it is descriptive history)
% the difference, however, is that it is about causal inference, which is implicitly about within-case counterfactuals
% generally, these are treated with a deterministic perspective on causality (if this hadn't happened, what would have happened instead?)

% application of logic and ``counterfactual'' method
% update beliefs about counterfactuals in sequence

% inductive versus deductive approach
% process tracing as a standalone method versus as a supplement to other methods
	% for example, often use very aggregated data to establish a relationship and process tracing to document how it comes about

\item Definition: ``An insight or piece of data that provides information about the context, process, or mechanism, and that contributes distinctive leverage in causal inference''\footnote{Brady and Collier 2004, p.277}
\item Might be used to:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Inductively generate hypotheses
	\item Deductively test a chain of causal relationships
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{columns}

	\begin{itemize}\itemsep0.5em
	\item Broad search for sequential steps necessary for an event to occur
	\item No \textit{a priori} expectations to test
	\item Analogous to detective work

% class examples: Sherlock Holmes stories are process-tracing tests of how murders (or other crimes) that link a potential cause (a murderer) to an outcome (a death) via a series of causal steps that leave behind pieces of evidence



\frame{
\frametitle{Deductive Process Tracing}

\begin{itemize}\itemsep1em
\item Sequence of within-case hypothesis tests
\item Theory or extant evidence guide chosen comparisons
	\begin{itemize}
	\item May iterate if there is no or very weak evidence for one's hypothesis(es)
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
}

% Example: smoking and cancer


\frame{
\frametitle{{\large Four Process Tracing Tests\footnote{Note: I am not a fan of this typology.}}}

Broadly consistent with Neyman-Pearson hypothesis testing.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Straw-in-the-wind test
\item Hoop test
\item Smoking gun test
\item Doubly decisive test
\end{enumerate}

}
% reason I do not like it is that it is difficult to specify a priori whether something is one of these types of tests
% part of process-tracing is not knowing what you're looking for, let alone whethere that evidence will or will not be consistent with expectations




\frame{
\frametitle{Major Caveat: Uncertainty}

\begin{itemize}\itemsep0.5em
\item Our uncertainty is a function of $n$
\item<2-> Process-tracing is a single-case design
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Reduce uncertainty by finding within-case variation
	\item Accept only high certainty about specific case % but high uncertainty about the general class of cases of which this case is a member
	\end{itemize}
\item<3-> Can we gather within-case DSOs at a lower level of analysis to better understand causality?
	\begin{itemize}
	\item<4-> Local-level geographical variation
	\item<4-> Across-time variation
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
